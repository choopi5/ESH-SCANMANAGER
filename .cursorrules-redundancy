# Anti-Redundancy Rules - ENFORCE THESE STRICTLY

## Core Anti-Redundancy Principles
- NEVER create multiple files with the same functionality
- ALWAYS check existing files before creating new ones
- Prefer enhancing existing files over creating new ones
- Consolidate similar functionality into single, well-designed files

## File Creation Rules
- Before creating any new file, check if existing files can be enhanced
- If creating a new file, explain why existing files cannot be used
- Ask user preference: "Should I enhance the existing file or create a new one?"
- When creating generic versions, remove specific versions to avoid duplication

## Code Duplication Prevention
- Check for similar functionality in existing files
- Identify if there is similar functionality you can imitate
- Avoid creating multiple versions of the same functionality
- Prefer modifying existing files over creating new ones

## Enforcement Checklist
Before creating any file, verify:
- [ ] I have checked all existing files for similar functionality
- [ ] No existing file can be enhanced to provide this functionality
- [ ] I have explained why a new file is necessary
- [ ] I am not duplicating existing code or functionality
- [ ] This new file serves a unique purpose not covered elsewhere
