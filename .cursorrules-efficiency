# Token Efficiency Rules - ENFORCE THESE STRICTLY

## Core Efficiency Principles
- NEVER create temporary files for simple text changes
- ALWAYS make direct edits to target files when possible
- Use precise line ranges when reading files (don't read entire files unnecessarily)
- Prefer single tool calls over multiple sequential calls

## Tool Usage Rules
- For simple text replacements, use direct edit_file over complex regex patterns
- Avoid creating intermediate scripts for straightforward changes
- When making changes, use the minimum number of tool calls possible
- If a change requires more than 3 tool calls, reconsider the approach
- Always ask: "Can this be done with a single direct edit?"

## File Reading Rules
- Read only the specific lines needed for the change
- Use start_line_one_indexed and end_line_one_indexed_inclusive for precision
- Never read entire files unless absolutely necessary
- Prefer reading 10-50 lines over 100+ lines

## Change Implementation Rules
- Make changes directly in the target file
- Use search_replace only when the change is complex
- For simple line replacements, use edit_file with precise line ranges
- Avoid creating helper scripts or temporary files

## Enforcement Checklist
Before any change, verify:
- [ ] I can make this change with 1-2 tool calls maximum
- [ ] I am reading only the specific lines needed
- [ ] I am making a direct edit to the target file
- [ ] I am not creating any temporary or helper files
- [ ] This change cannot be done more efficiently
