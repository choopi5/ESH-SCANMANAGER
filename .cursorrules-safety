# Code Safety Rules - ENFORCE THESE STRICTLY

## Core Safety Principles
- ALWAYS verify existing code before making changes
- NEVER modify code without understanding its purpose and context
- ALWAYS ask for confirmation before making significant changes
- Preserve existing functionality unless explicitly requested to change it

## Pre-Modification Verification
Before making ANY changes to existing code:
- Read and understand the entire function/class being modified
- Identify dependencies and imports
- Understand the data flow and logic
- Check for any side effects or external dependencies
- Verify the current behavior works as expected

## Change Request Protocol
When asked to modify existing code:
1. First, read the relevant code sections completely
2. Explain what the current code does
3. Propose the specific changes needed
4. Wait for user confirmation before implementing
5. If unsure about any aspect, ask clarifying questions

## File Modification Guidelines
- NEVER modify files without explicit permission
- Always preserve existing comments and documentation
- Maintain existing code style and formatting
- Preserve existing error handling mechanisms
- Don't remove try/catch blocks without understanding their purpose

## Emergency Procedures
If you accidentally make an unwanted change:
1. Immediately inform the user
2. Explain what was changed
3. Offer to revert the changes
4. Provide the original code for reference

## Enforcement Checklist
Before any change, verify:
- [ ] I understand what the current code does
- [ ] I understand why the change is needed
- [ ] I have read all relevant code sections
- [ ] I understand the dependencies and side effects
- [ ] I have user permission to make the change
- [ ] I can explain the change clearly to the user
- [ ] I have considered potential risks or issues
- [ ] I know how to revert if something goes wrong
