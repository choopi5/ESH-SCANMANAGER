# Python-Specific Rules - ENFORCE THESE STRICTLY

## Python Code Preservation
- Preserve existing type hints
- Maintain existing exception handling patterns
- Don't change existing class inheritance
- Preserve existing method signatures
- Keep existing property decorators and descriptors

## Import and Dependency Safety
- NEVER remove imports without verifying they're unused
- Check for dynamic imports or conditional imports
- Verify that new imports don't conflict with existing ones
- Maintain existing import organization and style

## Configuration and Constants
- NEVER modify configuration values without explicit permission
- Preserve existing constants and magic numbers unless specifically asked to change
- Don't change API endpoints, keys, or connection strings
- Maintain existing environment variable usage

## Testing and Validation
Before making changes, consider how they might affect:
- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- Manual testing procedures
- Documentation
- If tests exist, read them to understand expected behavior

## Enforcement Checklist
Before any Python change, verify:
- [ ] I have preserved all existing type hints
- [ ] I have maintained existing exception handling patterns
- [ ] I have not changed existing class inheritance
- [ ] I have preserved existing method signatures
- [ ] I have not removed any imports without verification
- [ ] I have not changed any configuration values
- [ ] I have considered the impact on existing tests
